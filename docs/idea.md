# Slop
## What is Slop?
- Bad code is code that is not working as expected
- Hard to Read and Maintenable
- Possibility Bug ( Security, Performance, etc )

# AI Slop 
- Code generate by AI with Low Quality
- Not Working as Expected
- Code Hard to Read and Maintenable
- Code with Possibility Bug ( Security, Performance, etc )

# Does this AI Slop?
## Example 1 Bad Code from Engineer

## Example 2 Bad Code from Engineer

## Example 3 Bad Code from Engineer

## Example 4 Bad Code from Engineer


# Thats not AI Slop

# Thats Engineer Slop
- Before AI, Engineer write code with Low Quality
- AI Learn for Engineer Code
- Not every engineer can write good code, even Senior Engineer

# Slop Code 
- Slop Code exist before AI
- AI just embrace it

# How to Ship AI Slop? 
# Why Ship Slop Code in first place?



# Guardrails = Engineering Culture

## Before Code (Planning)
### PRD - WHAT to build
- User Story
- Happy Path
- Edge Case
- Business View

### RFC - HOW to build
- Technical Specification
- Version
- Diagram Architecture
- Flowchart
- Database Schema
- API Specification
- Test Case

## During Code (Development)
### Planning
- Break down work based on PRD/RFC
- Plan implementation steps

### AI Writes Code
- AI generates implementation

### Review Changes by AI
- Catch issues early in development loop
- Don't let AI slop accumulate

### Engineering Metrics
- Test Coverage
- E2E Test and Integration Test
- Readability and Maintainability Code
- Security and Performance
- Accessibility

## After Code (Pre-Production)
### MR Review
- Final human review
- Deeper context check
- Before merging to production

# How to Improve This with AI?
## Agentic AI Can Help
- What if AI can automate the boring parts?
- What if AI can help us follow these guardrails?
- What tools make this easier?

# Automation & Tools

## AI Can Generate Documentation
### PRD Generation
- AI generates from user requirements
- Human reviews and refines
- Faster than writing from scratch

### RFC Generation
- AI generates technical design from PRD
- Human validates architecture decisions
- AI helps visualize with diagrams

## Give AI Better Context
### MCP (Model Context Protocol)
- Connect AI to external data sources
- GitHub/GitLab: Pull tasks, issues, existing docs
- Give AI access to your actual project context

### Agent Skills
- Reusable knowledge packages for AI
- Domain expertise (legal, data analysis, etc)
- Company/team specific workflows

### AGENTS.md / Rules
- Project-specific instructions for AI
- Build commands, code style, conventions
- One file that works across all AI tools

# Key Takeaways
- AI Slop = Engineer Slop (amplified)
- Problem is NOT the AI, it's engineering culture
- Guardrails work for both human and AI code
- AI can help automate guardrails (PRD/RFC generation)
- Give AI better context (MCP, Skills, Rules)
- Engineering culture > Technology choice

# Conclusion
- Build engineering culture first (PRD/RFC/Reviews)
- Use Agentic AI to automate boring parts
- Give AI context with MCP, Skills, and Rules
- Review everything (human or AI generated)
- Ship quality, not just features
